## About

Structure-based reasoning.  
Focused on boundaries, responsibility, and failure modes.

I tend to approach human–AI interaction problems  
as responsibility-boundary problems rather than capability problems.

Some of the work I publish (e.g., Zero Reflect)  
emerged from treating non-decision and boundary marking  
as first-class design constraints, rather than limitations.

## Main Work

- **Structure-based Reasoning Core / Axis Loss**  
  A collection of structure-based analysis artifacts focused on axis loss across layered systems.

  Focus areas include:
  - failure boundaries
  - responsibility attribution
  - non-remediable constraints

  LLM-assisted systems are treated as one observable instance, not the defining scope.

## Job — QA Tester (Since 2020.05-)

Focuses on issue reproducibility,
failure condition definition,
and responsibility-boundary clarification,
using functional and behavioral testing as analytical instruments.

- Perform functional and behavioral validation to identify defects.
- Produce issue reports based on reproducible conditions and observed behavior.
- When issues fall outside the team’s responsibility scope,
  define problem validity conditions and articulate responsibility boundaries
  for traceability and accountability.

## Scope Note

My job description reflects what I do at work.

My repositories document structures observed and analyzed
across everyday contexts involving humans
and systems (including AI),
independent of my job role.

Repository content is observational and analytical,
not job-specific practices, methods, or operational guidance.
