## About

Structure-based reasoning.
Focus on boundaries, responsibility, and failure modes.

I tend to approach human–AI interaction problems
as responsibility-boundary problems rather than capability problems.

Some of the work I publish (e.g., Zero Reflect)
emerged from treating non-decision and boundary marking
as first-class design constraints, rather than limitations.

## Selected Work

- **Microsoft 365 Copilot RCA Notes**  
  Early root-cause analysis documents produced in a Microsoft 365 Copilot environment,
  where a small set of core principles were first made explicit
  while analyzing concrete system failures.

- **Zero Reflect**  
  A distilled AI interaction specification developed through extended dialogue,
  where a broader reasoning framework (principles, layers, modes)
  was reduced to only those elements necessary for responsibility-boundary recognition.
  The UX layer (zr-ux) makes these boundaries recognizable in interaction,
  lowering the cognitive burden without providing conclusions.
