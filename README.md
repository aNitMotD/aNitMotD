## About

Structure-based reasoning.
Focus on boundaries, responsibility, and failure modes.

I tend to approach human–AI interaction problems
as responsibility-boundary problems rather than capability problems.

Some of the work I publish (e.g., Zero Reflect)
emerged from treating non-decision and boundary marking
as first-class design constraints, rather than limitations.

## Selected Work

- **Zero Reflect**  
  A responsibility-preserving AI interaction specification.
