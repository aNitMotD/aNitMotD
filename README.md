## About

Structure-based reasoning.  
Focused on boundaries, responsibility, and failure modes.

I tend to approach human–AI interaction problems  
as responsibility-boundary problems rather than capability problems.

Some of the work I publish (e.g., Zero Reflect)  
emerged from treating non-decision and boundary marking  
as first-class design constraints, rather than limitations.

## Main Work

- **Structure-based Reasoning Core / Axis Loss**  
  A collection of structure-based analysis artifacts focused on axis loss across layered systems.

  Focus areas include:
  - failure boundaries
  - responsibility attribution
  - non-remediable constraints

  LLM-assisted systems are treated as one observable instance, not the defining scope.
